### 4.6.1. Branching Process (cont'd)

#### 4.6.1.2. Extinction Probability (cont'd)

Draw $\psi(s)$ and function $f(s)=s$ between 0 and 1, we have two cases:

<p align="center">

</p>

The extinction probability $u$ will be the smallest intersection of $\psi(s)$ and $f(s)$. Equivalently, it is the smallest solution of the equation $\psi(s)=s$ between 0 and 1.

$\rightarrow\infty$

__Reason__: See the dynamics on a graph

$\Rightarrow$ $\begin{aligned}
    &\text{Case } 1: &u < 1   \\
    &\text{Case } 2: &u=1 & \text{ (extinction happens for sure.)}
\end{aligned}$. 

Q: How to tell if we are in case 1 or in case ?

A: check $\psi'(1)=\mathbb{E}(Y)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \psi'1(1) > 1 &\rightarrow &\text{ Case }1\\
& \psi'1(1) \leq 1 &\rightarrow &\text{ Case }2
\end{aligned}
 $$

Thus, we conclude:

- $\mathbb{E}(Y) > 1$ : an average more than 1 offspring
  - $\Rightarrow$ extinction with certain probability smaller than 1. $u$ is the smallest/unique solution between 0 and 1 of $\psi(s) = s$
- $\mathbb{E}(Y) \leq 1$ : an average less than or equal to 1 offspring
  - $\Rightarrow$ extinction happens for sure (with probability 1)

# 5. Poisson Processes

## 5.1. Counting Process

DTMC is a discrete-time process. That is, the index set $T=\{0,1,2,...\}$ and $\{X_n\}_{n=01,2,3,\cdots}$. 

We also want to consider the cases where time can be continuous,

$$ \text{Continuous-time processes: } T=[0,\infty\}$$
$$ \{X_t\}_{t\geq 0} \text{ or } \{X_{(t)}\}_{t\geq 0} $$

The simplest type of continuous-time process is counting process, which counts the number of occurrence of certain event before time $t$.

### Definition 5.1.1. Counting Process $N(t)$

Let $0\leq S_1\leq S_2\leq\cdots$ be the time of occurrence of some events. Then, the process
$$ \begin{aligned}
N(t) &:= \#\{n:S_n\leq t\}   \\
        &=\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1\!\!\!\perp_{\{S_n\leq t\}}
\end{aligned}$$
is called the counting process (of the events $\{S_n\}_{n=1,2,...}$)

Equivalently, $N(t) = n \iff S_n\leq t< S_{n+1}$

### Example 5.1.1

Calls arrive at a call center.

- $S_n$ : arrival time of the $n$-th call
- $N(t)$ : the number of calls received before time $t$

Other examples: cars passing a speed reader, atoms having radioactive decay, ...

### Properties of a counting process

1. $N(t)\geq 0, t\geq 0$
2. $N(t)$ takes integer values
3. $N(t)$ is increasing.
   - $N(t_1)\leq N(t_2)$ if $t_1\leq t_2$
4. $N(t)$ is right-continuous
   - $N(t) = \lim_{s\downarrow t}N(s)$

We also assume:

- $N(0) = 0$ (No event happens at time 0)
- $N(t)$ only has jumps at size 1.
  - (No two events happen at exactly the same time)

## 5.2. Definition of Poisson Process

### Interarrival Times

<p align="center">
    <img src="drawio_assets/5.2.interarrivaltimes.svg">
</p>

- $W_1, W_2, \ldots$
- $W_1=S_1$
- $W_n=S_n-S_{n-1}$ : interarrival time between $n-1$-th and the $n$-th event

### Definition 5.2.1. Renewal Process

A renewal process is a counting process for which the interarrival times $W_1, W_2, ...$ are independent and identical

ALl the three processes examples of counting processes can be reasonably modeled as renewal processes.

### Definition 5.2.2. Poisson Process

Poisson Process $\{X_{(t)}\}_{t\geq0}$ is a renewal process for which the interarrival times are exponentially distributed:

$$ W_n \stackrel{i.i.d}{\sim} Exp(\lambda)$$

A Poisson process $\{N(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ can be denoted as
$$ \{N(t)\}\sim Poi(\underbrace{\lambda}_{intensity} t) $$
